# Introduction
 As an introduction to this page, we are going to tell what is Raspberry Pi, how it works and its components. Later, we are going to give you an example of how to use Raspberry Pi in the real World.

**What is Raspberry Pi and How it works?**


 The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost computer with a compact size, about the size of a credit card, that can be connected to a computer monitor or a TV, and used with a standard mouse and keyboard. It is a small computer that runs a Linux operating system capable of allowing people of all ages to explore computing and learn to program languages like Scratch and Python. It is capable of performing most typical tasks of a desktop computer, from browsing the internet, playing high-resolution videos, handling office documents, to playing games.
 
Additionally, the Raspberry Pi has the ability to interact with the outside world, and it can be used in a wide variety of digital projects, from music and video players, parent detectors, weather stations to bird boxes with infrared cameras. We want you to see that the Raspberry Pi can be used by children and adults all over the world to learn programming and understand how computers work.

**GPIO pins:** One of the most alien features of a Raspberry Pi are the 40 shiny metal pins found on the top edge of the board. These are called GPIO pins, which stands for General-Purpose Input/Output. You can program these pins to control a huge variety of electronics, components, and other parts including LEDs, sensors, and motors.

**MicroSD card slot:** While most computers have some form of built-in storage your laptop often has a hard drive, for example a Raspberry Pi has no "onboard" storage.Instead, the software your computer runs on, known as the operating system (OS), and all of your files are stored on a microSD card, much like you might find in a digital camera.

**USB ports:** There are four USB ports you can use to plug in USB keyboards, mice, USB sticks, and other devices.

**USB-C Power Supply:** The USB-C power supply gives the device power. A USB-C cable can have a wall plug on the other end of it. Ensure that the output voltage of the charger is 5 volts and the input current is at least 2.5 volts.

**HDMI port:** Stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface, and this port is what you'll use to connect your Pi to a screen like a TV or a computer monitor.

**Camera connector:** Is clip-like connector labeled camera. It's the input for the official Raspberry Pi Camera Module.

**3.5mm Audio Jack:** Allows for connecting audio jack connectors for sound output.

**Micro USB power jack:** This is where you'll plug in the 5 V of power that every Raspberry Pi requires to work; this is the same sort of power input as many mobile phones. It's also worth noting that there is no power button! Your Pi will be on for as long as you keep the power cable connected.

**Ethernet network port:** This is for a wired internet connection.

**Quad-Core 1.4GHz processor:** In the middle of your Pi you'll see the brain of your computer. You may be wondering just how powerful your new purchase is: is it as fast as a laptop or a desktop computer? The processor, coupled with the Pis 1GB of RAM, gives the Raspberry Pi power that's roughly equivalent to some smartphones.

**RAM:** Random Access Memory (RAM) is temporary storage for the device. It holds active data so the computer can store and expel it.

**Speaker:** To enable sound output, this speaker may be linked to the Raspberry Pi.

**Color Sensor:** Colors may be detected by the Lego Spike's color sensor.

**Temperature Sensor:** This low-power instrument has the ability to sense temperature. In essence, it's a thermometer.

**Powered Lego Wheel:** The package does not include this Lego wheel. It is comparable to the PiWheel, which is made for the Raspberry Pi, though. But in contrast, the Lego wheel moves more slowly.

**Camera Module:** The Raspberry Pi is intended to use this 8 megapixel camera.

Wii remote control.

**NeoPixel Stick:** Depending on how the user configures it, the LEDs that make up the neopixel stick can show different colors.

**Raspberry Pi Build Hat:** To enable more Raspberry Pi connections, this device may be connected to the 40 pin GPIO. UltraSonic Distance Sensor: This gadget uses ultrasonic waves to detect distance. The time it takes for a wave to strike an object and return to the sensor is how it calculates distance.

For additional connections, use a 20-pin connector.


# How to use Raspberry Pi in real world. Step by Step.

First of all you need to have the Raspberry Pi. Once you have your Raspbery Pi you need to install an application call ....... . When you have the application you can start doing, in this case, the vending machine in the protoboard![F711F5ED-C853-4B4F-A4D9-020B4BF184C6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a51863a-650c-421b-98f6-96d4ce8cac63)


It has to look like this:

That was the first step, the second step is to create the code in the application you download before. ![F126A763-7BEF-4900-8090-316101964811](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2e9b11b-ca23-4a57-8898-fb2c7f61afe9)

The code has to look like this:.....
